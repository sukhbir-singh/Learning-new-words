1. Photobomb
Everyone loves to take a selfie – but who is that random person pulling a funny face in the background? They just photobombed you!

Use it: “That would have been a nice photo if that guy hadn’t photobombed us.”

2. Vape
A recent trend is to give up smoking cigarettes in favour of electronic ones. If you like “vaping”, then you’re a “vaper”.

Use it: “For the sake of my health I decided to give up smoking and try vaping.”

3. Glamping
If you like camping but are looking for something less muddy and more comfortable, you could try glamping – or glamorous camping. You still stay in a tent or tepee in the great outdoors, but usually you’ll be sleeping on a bed with pillows and duvets and there may even be a kitchenette and Wi-Fi.

Use it: “We wanted to try something a bit more luxurious than camping, so we booked to go glamping.”

4. Binge-watch
The huge take-up of on-demand TV and box sets have brought about this new word. It means to watch a large number of television shows, usually from the same series, in succession.

Use it: “I was ill last week, so I downloaded and binge-watched the whole of series one of Game of Thrones in one day!”

5. Meh
Originating from TV’s The Simpsons, this word has become a popular way to express the fact that you’re not bothered or impressed about something.

Use it: “I ordered a new dress online, but when I tried it on – meh.”

6. BRB
- be right back
Use it: brb in 30 mins.
