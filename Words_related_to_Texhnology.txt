Most search engines (e.g. Google) allow you to limit your search or make it more specific by using words such as "and", "or" and "not".

Cache
When you download (read) a web page, the data is "cached," meaning it is temporarily stored on your computer.
 The next time you want that page, instead of requesting the file from the web server, your web browser just accesses it from the cache, so the page loads quickly.
 The downside to this is that if the cached web page is often updated, you may miss the latest version. 
If you suspect that the web page you're seeing is not the latest version, use the "refresh" button on your browser.
